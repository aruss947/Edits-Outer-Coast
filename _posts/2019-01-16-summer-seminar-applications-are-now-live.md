<strong>[Apply for the 2019 Summer Seminar](http://outercoast.org/apply.html)</strong>

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar is a transformative educational experience built on the pillars of academics, service & labor, and self-governance.

Over the course of five weeks, Summer Seminar students will immerse themselves in two challenging, college-level academic courses, engage in consequential, labor-based service in Sitka, and interrogate the powers and responsibilities of self-governance. Last summer, students discussed [Tlingit Raven Stories](http://tlingitlanguage.com/raven/) and Plato’s Apology, re-sided a cracking, peeling garden shed, and tackled difficult community questions, like how to set a student body curfew. 

<strong>Cost of Attendance</strong>

Outer Coast will meet the financial need of all students. Family finances will not be a barrier to attendance. 

The Summer Seminar does not have a fixed cost of attendance. Instead, students and their parent(s) [set their own cost of attendance](http://outercoast.org/cost-of-attendance.html) based on their household’s financial means. 

<strong>Nominate a Student</strong>

Students do not need to be nominated in order to apply; nominations are simply a way for Outer Coast to identify promising potential applicants.

<strong>Quotes from 2018 Summer Seminar students:</strong>

I found the self-governance most meaningful to me. I liked having power with the other students and coming to agreements and making new rules.

 — 2018 Summer Seminar student from Shishmaref, AK
 
 Some readings and texts were really hard for me... But I’ve been able to push through, so that’s really rewarding too, and I’m really proud of myself for that. 

— 2018 Summer Seminar student from Anchorage, AK

What I’ll miss about Outer Coast most — it’s the community you gain. You live with these people twenty-four hours a day for three or four weeks, and you’re able to get so close to them. I’m really going to miss the community, I would say — the amazing people I lived with.

Cheers from the team,
