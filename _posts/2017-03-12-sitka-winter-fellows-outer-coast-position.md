On a separate note, Bryden and Jonathan are in Sitka this weekend working with Cecilia and Harry to push our work forward on multiple fronts including organizational capacity, program design, development, and incorporation! Bryden stopped on his way north to make connections in Juneau and he’ll be spending time in Anchorage this week. We’re excited to be building momentum together as a team as we head into the spring.

Cheers,

The Outer Coast Team

Bryden, Cecilia, Harry, Javier, Jonathan, Stephanie, Terrell & Will
