Outer Coast is hiring!

Looking for a summer opportunity in Sitka? We are considering applications for an [Outer Coast Summer Intern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyOSapK2eQNcsVsSuTt1lJmvhPy05poE63odfRtlKgk/edit?usp=sharing) to continue working on college planning while the Summer Seminar is underway.

Beyond the summer, we are looking for two bright, self-directed, and mission-aligned individuals to join the Outer Coast team via the [Alaska Fellows Program](http://alaskafellows.org/) beginning this September:

[The Development and Administration Fellow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1laB6v13mvP01OEdZUyTPI0qeevXHq5hP-yt0b8wXjQ8/edit?usp=sharing) is a primary collaborator on the Outer Coast team and works directly with the Development and Administration Associate.

[The Program and Operations Fellow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ij0u3bLkEfIcbJjO3EPoK1PyEGbKLrPSY9mD-T1fzew/edit?usp=sharing) assists and works with the Program and Operations Associate on all aspects of the project relating to operations and programming.

Both fellows work on Outer Coast as part of the [Alaska Fellows Program](http://alaskafellows.org/), a nine-month postgraduate fellowship that places recent college graduates with organizations across Alaska, in Sitka, Anchorage, and Juneau. The Outer Coast Fellows are based in Sitka, where they live in community with other fellows who serve a variety of organizations in the Sitka community.

The team convened in Juneau last weekend for three days of Summer Seminar admissions deliberations, and we are excited to announce that we have offered admission to 16 amazing young people from across the state and the country. Stay tuned for more news on our first cohort of students!

More soon, 

Bryden, Cecilia, Erin, Jonathan, and the Outer Coast team
