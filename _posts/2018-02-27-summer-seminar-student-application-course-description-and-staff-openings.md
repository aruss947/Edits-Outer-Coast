“How do I apply for the Summer Seminar?” “What kind of course will be taught?” Two questions that have kept us busy for the last couple months as we finalized our [Program Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17uKQuDQ-DmsDRuoPbSXRT9VK5i_VXQHQIBX-O9hsX44/edit?usp=sharing), went through draft upon draft of the student application, and interviewed a handful of brilliant and insightful faculty applicants.

We have some exciting news. Really. The core team is dancing with elation. 

We have answers to these questions! Moreover, we are thrilled to share the following announcements with you:

#### Summer Seminar Academic Course

_Perspectives on Freedom, Authority, and Polarization_ will be co-taught by two amazing faculty, X̱’unei Lance Twitchell (joining us for the first part of the seminar) and Sharon Schuman.

_Course Description:_

Gathered on the ancestral home of the Sheetkʼá Ḵwáan (People of the Outer Coast of Sheey), this seminar explores freedom, authority, and polarization through a series of readings and discussions that include diverse voices that shape and challenge our concepts of place, belonging, identity, and interactions. Readings will include Indigenous oral literatures, theories of cultural critique, classics of Western literature, and voices from the margins. The seminar focuses on freedom & authority as contested concepts and as potential remedies to polarization. Students will explore their developing views on these topics within a challenging context of self-government, labor, and community service.
