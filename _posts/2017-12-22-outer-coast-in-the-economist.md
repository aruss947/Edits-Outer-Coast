​Outer Coast is in the news! This year’s Christmas issue of _The Economist_ has an [exciting piece on Outer Coast and Deep Springs College](https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21732707-one-hundred-years-solitude-and-milking-cows-alternative-college-education), which highlights some of the similarities and differences between our models and approaches.

We think the article gets a lot of things right, but there’s one thing we’d like to make absolutely clear: we intend to meet the full financial need of all Outer Coast students, whether they hail from Alaska Native communities, the state of Alaska, the Lower 48, or around the world.

Your support will help us make that vision a reality for the Outer Coast Summer Seminar in July 2018, and we’d be thrilled if you can [contribute today](http://outercoast.org/contribute/).

Speaking of the Summer Seminar, we’re still in the process of choosing our inaugural faculty, so if there’s someone in your network who you think could be a good fit for [this position](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1muwxmbTquGUYlPMtug0kP1e_LoY_GB08gOSjyRct_tA/edit?usp=sharing) please spread the word. Our application window— and the tax year for donations—closes on December 31st.

Thank you for your ongoing interest and investment in Outer Coast and our vision for a better kind of higher education for all students.

With gratitude,

Bryden, Cecilia, Jonathan, Sara, and the whole Outer Coast team
