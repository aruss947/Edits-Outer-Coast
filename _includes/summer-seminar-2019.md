<strong>About</strong>

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar 2019 offers a diverse cohort of up to 32 Alaskan and Lower 48 high school students (current sophomores and juniors) a transformative academic experience and the opportunity to engage with the world around them in multiple dimensions. 

Over the course of five weeks, students immerse themselves in a fast-paced, college-level academic course; participate in a meaningful, work-based service program; and explore the powers and responsibilities of self-governance.

The goals for the Summer Seminar are threefold: to bring together curious and motivated high school students and create a community of learning; to offer a transformative, community-centered educational opportunity that inspires students to become forces for positive change within their own communities; and to increase the likelihood that Summer Seminar students matriculate at match and fit colleges by introducing them to college-level academic work and orienting them to the college admissions process.

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar does not have a fixed cost of attendance. Instead, we ask that the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) complete the appropriate form to set their own cost of attendance based on their householdâ€™s financial means. This form will be sent to the student upon admission. Outer Coast will meet the financial need of all students. Cost will not be a barrier to attendance.
