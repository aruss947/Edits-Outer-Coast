# Contribute

Please consider contributing to the Outer Coast project. At this stage every contribution, large or small, financial or otherwise, makes a disproportionate difference to our ultimate success.

## Legal & Graphic Design Help

We are seeking pro bono assistance with graphic design and logo design, as well as pro bono legal assistance â€” especially from lawyers with nonprofit experience. If you, or anyone, might be able to offer help, [please let us know]({{ site.root }}/contact.html).

## Donations

We also welcome early financial support. As we take steps forward with accreditation, Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education regulatory processes, incorporating as a nonprofit and writing bylaws, negotiating an MOU partnership with Sheldon Jackson Campus, and more, we increasingly need to match our sweat equity and pro bono contributions with financial contributions.

To make a financial contribution to Outer Coast, use the PayPal button below or send a check (made out to Outer Coast College) to this address:

> Sitka, AK 98835

We (and future generations of Outer Coast students) sincerely appreciate your support. Thank you!
