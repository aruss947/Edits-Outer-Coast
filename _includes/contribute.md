# Contribute

The vision for Outer Coast has made improbable progress over the two-plus years because many motivated people have invested their time, dollars, and expertise. Would you like to contribute to the cause?

## Contribute Your Time

Are you a lawyer with expertise in the nonprofit sector? Are you a visual artist with experience in graphic design and logo design? Are you interested in collaborating with Outer Coast on a pro bono basis? If so, [please let us know]({{ site.root }}/contact.html).

## Contribute Financially

Please invest in the launch of the Outer Coast Summer Seminar. Your contribution, matched by larger gifts, will help us raise the $80,000 we need to secure student housing and classrooms, pay faculty and program staff, provide financial aid to all students who need it, and put in place this important stepping stone to open the college.
