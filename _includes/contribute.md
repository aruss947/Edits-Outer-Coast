# Contribute

The vision for Outer Coast has made improbable progress over the last year and a half because many motivated people have pooled their time, dollars, and expertise. Would you like to contribute to the cause?

## Contribute Your Time

Are you a lawyer with nonprofit experience? Are you a visual artist with experience in graphic design and logo design? Are you interested in collaborating with Outer Coast on a pro bono basis? If so, [please let us know]({{ site.root }}/contact.html).

## Contribute Financially

We also welcome early financial contributions. As we take steps forward with accreditation, Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education regulatory processes, incorporating as a nonprofit and writing bylaws, negotiating an MOU partnership with Sheldon Jackson Campus, and more, we increasingly need to match our sweat equity and pro bono contributions with financial contributions.

We (and future generations of Outer Coast students) sincerely appreciate your support. Thank you!
