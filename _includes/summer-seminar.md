### Outer Coast Summer Seminar

Outer Coast, building toward becoming a two-year college, hosted its first Summer Seminar for high school students in 2018. The program was a great success in its first year, so Outer Coast will be hosting a bigger and better version again in the summer of 2019.

The inaugural Outer Coast Summer Seminar took place July 6 - August 4, 2018. 16 students flocked to Sitka from across Alaska and the Lower 48. Hereâ€™s a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1PtDqfOjjLK8z1KPT-F2OwsXohs8ujir5&ll=39.35637482034097%2C0&z=2) of where the students came from.
