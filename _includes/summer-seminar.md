### Outer Coast Summer Seminar

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar offers a diverse cohort of Alaskan and Lower 49 high school students (current sophomores and juniors) a transformative academic experience and the opportunity to engage with the world they are about to inherit.

Over the course of four weeks, students immerse themselves in a fast-paced, college-level academic course; experiment with limited powers of self-governance; and participate in a meaningful service program.

The goals for the Summer Seminar are threefold: to bring together a diverse cohort of curious and motivated high school students and create a community of learning; to offer a transformative, community-centered educational opportunity that inspires students to become forces for positive change within their own communities; and to increase the likelihood that Summer Seminar students matriculate at college by introducing them to college-level academic work and orienting them to the college admissions process.

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar does not have a fixed cost of attendance. Instead, we ask that the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) complete the appropriate form to set their own cost of attendance based on their household’s financial means. This form will be sent to the student once their application has been reviewed. Outer Coast will meet the financial need of all students. Cost will not be a barrier to attendance.

The inaugural Outer Coast Summer Seminar took place July 6 - August 4, 2018 in Sitka, Alaska. 16 students flocked to Sitka from across Alaska and the Lower 49. Here’s a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1PtDqfOjjLK8z1KPT-F2OwsXohs8ujir5&ll=39.35637482034097%2C0&z=2) of where the students came from.

Academics 
 
Students spent their mornings in the classroom, discussing ideas of freedom, authority, and polarization, and engaging with both Indigenous and Western literary texts. They began and ended the class with a reflection on two questions: “what does it mean to be free?” and “why do we tell stories?” The 2018 Summer Seminar academic course offering was Perspectives on Freedom, Authority, and Polarization, co-taught by X̱’unei Lance Twitchell, Sharon Schuman, and Ishmael Hope.

Service 
 
During the afternoon, students participated in meaningful service projects throughout Sitka. They developed new skills, challenged themselves physically, and gained an appreciation for serving community. Students worked alongside the Forest Service to maintain Indian River Trail and supported the Sitka Fine Arts Camp by shingling a garden shed and staining an administrative building. On Fridays, students had the opportunity to choose their own service projects. They chose to pick salmonberries and make pies for residents at the Pioneer Home and to help clean and maintain the women’s shelter in Sitka.  Over the course of the Summer Seminar, students logged a total of 84 service hours per person and 1,344 hours as a student body.

Self-governance
 
At the close of the program, students reflected that self-governance was both the most rewarding and challenging aspect of the Summer Seminar. After the initial chaos of trying to decide on a governing structure without having a model by which to make decisions, students adopted and refined a consensus-based decision-making process. Over the course of the seminar, students continued to refine the skill of making group-based decisions. In addition to selecting and planning weekly service projects, they also invited local speakers to participate in a biweekly Community Hour, created a values document, and reviewed and passed a number of motions pertaining to community policies.
