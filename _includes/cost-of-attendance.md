### Cost of Attendance

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar does not have a fixed cost of attendance. Instead, we ask that the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) to set their own cost of attendance based on their household’s financial means. This cost of attendance includes academic tuition, room, and board for the duration of the Summer Seminar. The cost of travel to and from Sitka may also be covered, depending on student need. Students will be sent the cost of attendance form after an offer of admission has been made.

Outer Coast will meet the financial need of all students. Cost will not be a barrier to attendance. 

Outer Coast Summer Seminar admissions decisions are determined through a need-blind process. This means that what a student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) are able to pay will not influence the student’s chances of admission.
