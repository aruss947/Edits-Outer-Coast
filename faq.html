    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Do you have a campus?</h3>

      <p>
        No, but we're talking about it! The nationally renowned Sitka Fine Arts Camp owns and is restoring the Sheldon Jackson Campus. We are both excited about the possibility of Outer Coast College on Sheldon Jackson Campus, but nothing is decided and there are many important details to work through.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Where is the campus?</h3>

      <p>
        Sheldon Jackson Campus is in the heart of Sitka, Alaska, a few hundred meters from Sitka’s downtown and bordering the beautiful Sitka National Historical Park.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>When do you start taking applications?</h3>

      <p>
        At the earliest, fall 2016, with admitted students enrolling in fall 2017. We want to emphasize that this is the most optimistic possible timeline.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Will there be any gender-based eligibility requirements?</h3>

      <p>
        No, none at all. A point of differentiation from Deep Springs, Outer Coast College welcomes all students, regardless of gender.

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Will credits from Outer Coast be transferable to four-year universities?</h3>

      <p>
        Yes. Outer Coast is exploring accreditation through partner institutions, simultaneous to the larger process of applying for independent accreditation.
